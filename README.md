# Workspaces

Workspaces is a Chrome extension for simple tab management.

Each workspace automatically saves the tabs in its dedicated browser window (Workspaces no longer relies on Chrome Tab Groups). When you reopen a workspace, a new window is created with the exact set of tabs you left off, plus a small pinned “marker tab” that identifies the workspace so the extension can reattach to it after restarts.
